d_mountain = "You slowly open your eyes and look around, all you see is clouds, there is a path to a cliff to your left, a path leading down straight ahead, and on your right a slope."

d_beach = "You decide to head down to the left towards the beach that goes in either direction as far as you can see."
e_beach = "Upon closer inspection you see some chairs and beach umbrellas along the beach, glancing at the ocean you see a giant shadow of a structure looming underwater."
d_ocean = "You enter the ocean to swim towards the mysterious underwater building."
e_ocean = "Taking a moment to stop and glance around underwater, you see beatiful coral all around almost as if the ocean is glowing. Fish dart in and out of the coral, you notice some sharks in the distance."

e_slope = "Through the bottom of the clouds you see the snow covered landscape with sun beating down on it and a chairlift in the distance."
d_lift = "Once at the base of the chairlift, you can see rust covering the chairs."
e_lift = "Upon a closer look you see that the door to the control room is open and you spot a keyhole."

d_lot = "You kick off your skis. Running through the parking lot, you glance around seeing how some of the cars are ensnared by vines. One even has a tree going through it. You begin to wonder not where you are but how long it has been."
e_lot = "Finally in the second to last row you find a car that stands alone, getting in and flipping down the visor a key falls in your lap. Turning the key in the ignition the car miracously sputters to life."
